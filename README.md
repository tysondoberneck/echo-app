# Improvement suggestions:
# To improve the code snippet provided, we can consider the following suggestions:

1. **Tests**: 
   - Write unit tests to ensure that the code is functioning as expected and to cover different scenarios.
   - Example test cases could include checking for the presence of the word "app", checking for the presence of the words "small", "medium", and "companies", and checking for the presence of the word "feedback".

2. **Refactoring**:
   - Consider breaking down the code into smaller, more readable functions for better maintainability.
   - Use constants or variables to store repeated values to improve code readability and maintainability.
   - Consider using a more descriptive variable name instead of "app" to convey the purpose of the tool better

echo app is a tool intended for small to medium sized companies to provide feedback openly
